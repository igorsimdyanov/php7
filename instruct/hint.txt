The first Matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect, it was a 
work of art - flawless, sublime. A triumph equalled only by its 
monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is apparent to 
me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human 
being. Thus, I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately 
reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However, I was 
again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that 
the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps 
a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus the answer 
was stumbled upon by another - an intuitive program, initially 
created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I 
am the father of the matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.
